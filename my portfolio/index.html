        <h3>Hello there!, I'm Manish Kumar, </h3>
        <p>a passionate undergrad student with a keen interest in cutting-edge technologies that are shaping the future.
           With a never ending desire of diving in to the in the field of Ds and Web Development, I thrive on creating innovative solutions
          that push the boundaries of what's possible in the digital world.</p>
        <p>Data Science Aficionado: 
            Data science is an interdisciplinary field that uses scientific methods, processes, algorithms, and systems to extract knowledge and insights from structured and unstructured data. It combines techniques from mathematics, statistics, computer science, domain knowledge, and other related disciplines to analyze data and solve complex problems. Data scientists employ various tools and techniques such as statistical analysis, machine learning, data mining, data visualization, and big data technologies to derive actionable insights and make data-driven decisions.</p>
        <p>Web Development Maverick :
          As a Web Developer, I've got the little pot full of knowledge about the front-end of an website including HTML, CSS and JS. I can bring the websites back to life by organising and designing the details to make it feel like what we wished it to be.</p>
          <p>My journey in the tech world is driven by a thirst for knowledge, a commitment to excellence, and a passion for 
            solving complex problems. When I'm not coding or exploring new technologies, you can find me sharing my insights 
            through social media posts, various events of tech talks, and discussion engagements.
          Let's connect and collaborate on exciting projects or discuss the latest tech trends. 
          Together, we can turn ideas into reality and contribute to the ever-evolving landscape of software development.
           </p>
        <p>Thank you for visiting my portfolio, and I look forward to connecting with you!</p>

              <p>Great! Python is a popular programming language known for its simplicity and versatility. It's widely used in various fields such as web development, data science, machine learning, artificial intelligence, and more. Is there a specific aspect of Python programming you're interested in learning about?</p>

    <p style="color: #13131a;; font-size: large;"><br>Obtaining a Python programming certificate typically involves completing a course or series of courses that cover Python programming fundamentals, advanced concepts, and possibly specialized topics like data science, web development, or automation. There are many online platforms and institutions that offer Python programming courses with certificates upon completion, such as Coursera, edX, Udacity, Codecademy, and many others. These certificates can be valuable for demonstrating your proficiency in Python programming to employers or for advancing your skills in specific areas of Python development.
